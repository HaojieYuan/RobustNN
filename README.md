### RobustNN

This project is mainly about reproducing and testing defense methods for adversarial attacks.

### Defense methods mainly includes:
##### Training
Change training methods to achieve a more robust neural network. Includes adversrail training, defensive distillation and so on.
##### Modify Netwworks
Modify network itself to resist attacks. e.g. add mask in hidden layers.
##### Detecting
Detect adversarial examples before evaluation. This method is most appliciable due to other mothods may have negative effects on
model accuracy.

### Progress
##### Evaluation scripts (Done)
##### Auxiliary detectors in hidden layers (In Progress)
##### SqueezeNet (Pending)
##### MagNet (Pending)
